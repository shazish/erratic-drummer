## What exactly is Erratic Drummer?

*Erratic Drummer* is an automatic drum pattern generator. You can customize drum patterns based on tempo, length, pattern density, as well as tweak presence of each drum instrument.

This is a passion project and is meant to stay free. To keep it a clean experience, ads of any kind have been avoided. If *Erratic Drummer* gives you a kick (pun intended!), or helps you with songwriting ideas, please spend a minute to rate it on Google Play!
